no one can tell me,
All around the mulberry bush,
nobody knows.
The monkey chased the weasel.
where the wind comes from,
The monkey thought 'twas all in fun.
where the wind goes.Pop! goes the weasel.

A penny for a spool of thread,
A penny for a needle.
That's the way the money goes.
Pop! goes the weasel.

Up and down the City Road,
In and out of the Eagle,
That's the way the money goes.
Pop! goes the weasel.

Half a pound of tuppenney rice,
Half a pound of treacle,
Mix it up and make it nice,
Pop! goes the weasel.
